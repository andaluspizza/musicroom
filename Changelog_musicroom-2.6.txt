*sigh* where should I start.

New features:
* Renamed project to "Music Room Interface", which is a way less bulky name, sounds better, and should still preserve the essence
* Replaced the static game name label with a list box, offering direct game selection, and support for games without directories
* gamedirs.cfg saves those local game directories, providing direct access to the games on subsequent program calls.

* Banshiryuu (and PBG6 archive) support. If there are other games with music encrypted in PBG6, please let me know!
* Added a nice progress bar used for various time-consuming tasks

* Included the Ogg Vorbis encoder natively in the program, and added support for chained bitstream output.
  That only works with either lossless or chained bitstream Ogg Vorbis input files, though

* Added a nice encoding settings dialog

Improvements:
* Improved automatic search of the tag update function
* Improved readability of Wiki update text. Should now look OK against every skin ever.
* Updater now automatically resolves Wiki redirects (because the Touhou Wiki guys can't stop moving stuff around -.-)
* Ported streaming engine to DirectSound for enhanced features. Quite nerve-wracking porting work, until I decided to reinvent the wheel.
  Yeah, I wanted to use OpenAL instead, but all this 3D stuff is complete overkill for a project like this. And SDL's too basic, so...
  that basically seals all plans for a native Linux version. But hey, Wine's good enough by now, so nobody should care.
* Moved some information from the readme file into the program, because no one reads readme files after all
* Many other, lesser speed increases in other places. Yeah, I played around a bit for no real reason than to show off better profiling times.
* Status box now replaces game names if language is switched

Technical:
* Split the program into a back-end library (bgmlib) and the front-end GUI part (musicroom)
* Entirely recoded the tagging engine to get rid of the bloat and some bugs of taglib.
  Yes, that was a bad idea, and one week of wasted work, but now it's less ugly (?),
  and tailor-made for the needs of the international Touhou community and future i18n plans
* Many lesser speed increases in other places. Yeah, I played around a bit for no real reason than to show off better profiling times.
* musicroom.exe now links directly against the native msvcrt.dll. Say goodbye to 1 MB of useless M$ DLLs

- 2010/11/16
* The "Yes" option in the Wiki update dialog is actually working now. Seems like I failed logic yet again.
* You may now enter fractional fade durations

- 2010/10/29
* Fixed a fatal bug with IaMP which would hang the system in a very gruesome manner if one tried to load that game
* Fixed high CPU usage in playing mode

- 2010/10/28
* Option to pull updated track info from the Touhou Wiki
* Tag update function, which directly writes track info without re-encoding everything

* Added support for Kioh Gyoku, MegaMari and PatchCon...
* ... and modified some BGM info config keys to manage that
* Added a BGM template file if anyone is interested in adding support for other games I don't have

* More friendly handling of trial versions by testing available tracks
* Extraction and tag update processes run in extra threads now, and you can stop those any time
* Countless GUI improvements and smaller bugs fixed
* We have an official link now, yay~

- 2010/09/15
* Fixed a number of GUI inconveniences. The extraction processes now don't deadlock the GUI anymore.

- 2010/08/16
* Fixed an oversight with the silence removal, which was checked byte- instead of sample-wise (yes, embarrassing, I know).

- 2010/08/14
* Initial release, named "Touhou Project BGM Extractor", containing music data from TH06 to TH12.8
